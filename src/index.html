        <ol> How to Play Battleship:
          <li>Each player has a game board with two grids: one where they place their own ships and one where they keep
            track of their opponent's moves.</li>
          <li>Before the game begins, each player secretly places their ships on their grid. The ships can be placed
            horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally, and cannot overlap.</li>
          <li>Once the ships are placed, players take turns calling out a grid coordinate on their opponent's board,
            attempting to hit one of their opponent's ships.</li>
          <li>If a player successfully hits all of their opponent's ship's spaces, they win the game.</li>
